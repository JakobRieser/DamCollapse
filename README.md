# Dam Collapses Brazil

On November 5, 2015, two dams collapsed in southeastern Brazil, sending a torrent of mining sludge through the village of Bento Rodrigues. The muddy floodwaters from an iron ore mining operation destroyed hundreds of homes, killed 19 residents, and left others missing.

The Wall Street Journal reported that 60 million cubic meters of wastewater were unleashed, with most of it affecting Bento Rodrigues. The village is located close to the breach, and sits in a river valley just below one of the dams.

The effects of the flooding were felt far beyond Bento Rodrigues. Multiple rivers, far from the village, remained swollen with wastewater and mud. East of this image, in Barra Longa—a village about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the dams—the river surged as much as 15 meters and flooded homes. As health officials conducted tests, cities as far as 300 kilometers (200 miles) downstream lost access to drinking water, which is equal to 250,000 people.

On January 25, 2019, another retaining wall abruptly failed along the edge of a pond of mud-like waste material from a Brazilian mine. The collapse at the Córrego do Feijão mine in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais released a torrent of tailings that quickly flattened buildings, overwhelmed a bus, and swamped nearby houses. Tailings rushed through the mine, the nearby town of Brumadinho, and the Paraopeba River, a key source of drinking and irrigation water for people in the area. More than 100 people have died.

The dam had held back more than 15 million cubic yards (11.7 million cubic meters) of waste material, according to the company that operates the mine. After the failure, the mud deposits downstream were as thick as 5 meters (16 feet) in some places.
